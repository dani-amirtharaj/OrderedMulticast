# OrderedMulticast
Implemented a multicast protocol based on the ISIS ordering algorithm, that allows users to multicast messages to other devices on a network, in an ordered fashion ( FIFO and total orderings), with failure detection (crash-stop) and handling.
Network communication was managed using the Java Socket API.
